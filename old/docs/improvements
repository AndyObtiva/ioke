Condition system?

. is cons/pair
 so, you can write
 {"a" . "b", "c" . "d"}
and this will generate the equivalent of
 {:a => :b, :c => :d} in Ruby

.. and ... is obviously range

Object hierarchy
(uses : to namespace methods) 


BasicObject
  internal:get-slot
  internal:set-slot

CoreMethods
  square-brackets
  curly-brackets 
  get-slot
  set-slot
  ...

Object < BasicObject, CoreMethods
