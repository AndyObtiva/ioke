  futures with agents, like Io, agents are a thread pool, futures become the real value when needed. agents can be spun off too. use some other syntax since @ is taken.
  lazy operator is a lexical kinda thing that just does the operations inside it when it's needed. 
  a future implemented in terms of aspects:
   Future before(:any, except: [:become, :forceResult], 
                   self become(self forceResult))

- look at linked maps for internal representation
