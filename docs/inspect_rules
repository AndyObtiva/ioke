I think the rules will be like this:

 inspect will by default call cellSummary

 but will be overridden from most other things.


In Io there is:

slotSummary
asString
asSimpleString

These should possibly translate to:

cellSummary
 ->

 Object_0x30C7D0:
  Lobby            = Object_0x30c7d0
  Protos           = Object_0x30cac0
  exit             = method(...)
  forward          = method(...)

inspect
  same same
 str
 1
 method( some code... blah )

notice
 Object_0x30C7D0
 "str"
 1
 method(...)

review the places where inspect is used and probably change to notice
