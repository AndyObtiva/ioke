can't do. make it simple. use hash:

#/foo/ =~ "foo"


Quite simple:
   what can come before a regexp?
foo() / 123 /
  is not a regexp
x(/ 123 /) is a regexp
x(x, /123/) is a regexp
/123/ is a regexp

foo = /123/ is foo =(/123/)
foo =~ /123/ is foo =~(/123/)
foo operator /

The rules are thus:
 it can only be a regexp if the previous token was an operator of some kind, or if the prior token was a terminator, or a ','. 
 otherwise it's a division operator.
