Different code block versions:
(Maybe change ioke.lang.Method in Java into ioke.lang.Code)
method = strict oo, evaluated in object called on, no lexical scope, regular call-by-value arguments
fn = lambda = block = lexical scoping. might need to have something to allow both lexical and obj lookup.
what should dynamic lookup be called? dynFn? should there be dynamic lookup at all? could probably be faked anyway.
