Sam had this neat Ruby library, doing things like:

 x = op 'x < 10'
 y = op 'x > 5'

 x & y

 x.complement

and so on


------------------------

In Ioke we can do this on Lexical blocks quite easily:

 x = fn(x, x < 10)
 y = fn(y, y > 5)
 (x & y)(7)

 x complement

 another alternative:

   x = op(< 10)
   y = op(> 5)
