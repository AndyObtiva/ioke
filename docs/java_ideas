All classes NEED to be wrapped - the whole hierarchy immediately. Wrap all methods too. The regular objects shouldn't be necessary to wrap.



Origin mimics JavaGround

How to refer to full class names?
   Foo
   java:util:HashMap
   xml:com:sun:blarg:Foo$Bar$Quux  ;; inner classes
   xml:com:sun:blarg:Foo Bar Quux  ;; inner classes

Importing:
  JavaGround#import

   import(java:util:HashMap)

 assignment works too:

   HMap = java:util:HashMap

The class referred is the real class.

Create new instances with new

   HMap new

To figure out:
 - how to call overloaded methods
 - args by name functionality?
 - how to send code to Java methods?
    maybe something like this:
      Thread new(Runnable: callSomeExpensiveThing)
      Thread new(run: callSomeExpensiveThing)
      Collections sort(list, fn(x, y, x <=> y))
      Collections sort(list, compareTo: (x, y, x <=> y))

 - how to see difference between fields and methods
 - how to implement interfaces
 - how to extend from Java classes in some way


 - add loads of good helpers to Java types
