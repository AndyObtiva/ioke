inside of if and unless, while and until
----------------------------------------
an ItContext is established. this context handles the "it" name specially.
it's a dynamic variable, but it's also lexically closureable:

if(42*3, fn([it, if(13, fn(it))])) call call ; == [126, 13]

Using it is a bit ugly, but it solves the problem of regexps. The pattern will be:

if(#/foo/ =~ "foo",
  it match println,
  "No match found")

Blog about this. note how it is different from using a magic variable inside of blocks, which is really different.
