How to handle Java interop? How to handle calling of methods with interfaces? Closure conversion would be nice indeed. Maybe use a call to [] to specify that closure conversion is wanted:

button addActionHandler(fn("hello" println))
button addActionHandler [ "hello" println ]
button addActionHandler {"hello" println}

Maybe curly braces since it's a language that like this.

button addActionHandler {e, "hello" println}

This means that all Java methods need to be macros that check if their next method call is a curlyBracket call.
