There should be generic aspects:

All objects have:
Origin after(mimic, returnValue initialize(arg[0]))
probably add specific keywords inside the actual aspect...


Person = Origin mimic
Person after(:mimic, checkInvariants)
Person before(:hello, doSomething)
Person around(:with, somethingElse)


maybe also add something in the style of

before(*any, log)
before(match: :any, log)

before(match: #/foo/, log)

etc
